Node is a platform that uses JavaScript for creating network applications.It gives us a server-side environment that can handle logic written in Javascript. It allows JavaScript to be run on a server. Express is a light-weight, web application framework for writing RESTful APIs in Node.js.

## Starting a node app

The first thing you do is to install node on your machine using homebrew
```
brew install node
```
Create a new folder for your node project
```
mkdir node-project
```
You then need to initialize node inside your project folder using:
```
npm init
```
This will create a package.json file where the values we just set up via npm init.

You then create your entry point
```
touch index.js
```
You then can run your project:
```
node index.js
```
